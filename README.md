# Tonho, School Management App

## The WHY?

I created this app as a learning project for someone who has limited fullstack experience. I have also found the need to give this app a life.

## The building blocks

### Zhou aka the Backend

Zhou is an elephant in Shona. This is a Django Restframework app with Djoser for auth. Using Postgres RDBMS

### Shuro aka the Frontend

Shuro is a rabbit in Shona. This is the frontend for our app. It uses React.
